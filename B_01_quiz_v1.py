**** Instructions ****
To begin, you choose the number of questions you would like
to be asked. Press <enter> for infinite. 

Then you may either customise the operation, or go with the
default quiz. (where a random operation is chosen)
Answer the questions, aiming to get as many correct as possible.
If you get one wrong, the computer will show the correct answer.

Good luck!
